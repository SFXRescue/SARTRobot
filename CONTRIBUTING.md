# How to contribute

We're really glad you're interesting in contributing, or maybe you clicked the wrong file, either way, we're glad you're here!

## Contributing

We're always open to contributions! If you feel that there's something you can add, or you want to make a feature request, please do!

Even if it's that might be a bit out of scope of the project, feel free to make an Issue or create a Pull Request and we can discuss it; we're all pretty nice people.

## Submitting changes

When creating a Pull Request, have a clear list of what you've done, follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine, we're not too fancy about that sort of stuff.

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. It's mostly common sense.
- Python follows PEP8 guidelines in most cases
- JavaScript follows whatever makes the most sense
- HTML classes are styled like `a-fancy-class` and IDs are `the_best_element`

Thanks,
The Semi-Autonomous Rescue Team
