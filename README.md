# SARTRobot
The scripts and programs written by the SFXRescue team for the S.A.R.T. v2 rescue robot.
## Current
**Current** contains the code that is run on the robot. One should be able to simply download the "Current" folder and move all the scripts to the appropriate locations to expect a functional robot.
#### PHP / HTML:
- [html/**index.php**](current/html/index.php): The default interface page containing the structure of the page and some JavaScript.
- [html/**controlscript.php**](current/html/controlscript.php): JavaScript file that listens to keystrokes and sends a movement type and speed to the websocket server run by movement.py. The PHP file extension lets the server pass the IP.
- [html/**downloadsnapshot.php**](current/html/downloadsnapshot.php): PHP file that allows for the download of a camera image outside the web directory
- [html/**restart.php**](current/html/restart.php): Restart program
- [html/**shutdown.php**](current/html/shutdown.php): Shutdown program
#### Python:
- [python/**servo_party.py**](current/python/servo_party.py): This script controls the movement of the robot. It has 3 dependancies: pyax12, asyncio and websockets.
- [python/**sensor_party_server.py**](current/python/sensor_party_server.py): This script creates a websocket server to send sensor data collected from the robot to the control panel. It has 3 dependancies: pyserial, asyncio and websockets.
- [python/**performance_party_data.py**](current/python/performance_party_data.py): This script creates a websocket server to send robot performance data to be displayed on the control panel. It has 3 dependancies: psutil, asyncio and websockets.
- [python/**servo_party_data.py**](current/python/servo_party_data.py): This script creates a websocket server to send servo performance data to the control panel to be displayed. It has 3 dependancies: pyax12, asyncio and websockets.
- Websocket ports include: servo_party = 5555, servo_party_data = 5556, sensor_party_server = 5557 and performance_party_data = 5558
#### Arduino:
- [arduino/sensor_party/**sensor_party.ino**](current/arduino/sensor_party/sensor_party.ino):

## Testing
**Testing** contains old code or test scripts that for whatever reason still need to be used.
#### HTML:
- [html/**websockettest.html**](testing/html/websockettest.html): Companion HTML file for websockettest.py. Testing script for the websocket.
#### Python:
- [python/tests/**websockettest.py**](testing/python/tests/websockettest.py): Companion Python file for websockettest.py. Testing script for the websocket.

## Retired
**Retired** contains code that is not used in the current project or testing but may need to be referred to.
