## About

The SARTInterface is the complete browser-based control interface used to control the S.A.R.T. robots. 
Features include:
- Support for up to four video camera streams
- Live sensor data graphs and charts from connected thermal camera, temperature sensors, distance sensors, and eCO2 / TVOC levels, as well as system information, such as uptime, CPU temp and memory usage.
- A tabbed SSH console interface, providing unrestricted direct access to the robot's underlying OS
- A powerful configuration file editor, to adjust every option of both the robot and the interface, including what sensors and cameras are enabled, what ports to use, and individual settings for each sensor.
- Light and dark themes

Users never have to access the S.A.R.T hardware directly â€“ everything can be done within the interface.
